After adjusting the different variables like the amount of checkers, , items brought, and wait time;
you can quickly figure out that 5 checkers was more than enough for customers getting few than 10 items, 
before idle time started piling up.  The wild card would be the store preparing for customer coming at 
a rate higher than every 2 minutes- maybe during lunch breaks or rush hour.  Adjusting the different
variables all had it's pro's and cons, but balancing the shopper and store goals would make
everyone generally happy; increasing the number of checkers, improving customer experience- resulting
to more returning customers.  The other data I wanted to process was subtracting checkout time by the customers 
arrival time giving us the metric TotalTime in store.  This data can help identify times where the store
is congested or not.... Helping the store know when more checkers are needed or suggesting a better 
store layout.
